The environment you are using is one of a set of applications useful in hosting training workshops. These can be supervised workshops run in a classroom like environment, or can be self paced workshops provided via an online interactive learning portal.

In this workshop you will learn how to deploy a leaning portal in OpenShift for training anonymous users, where the training can be done at any time.

You will also learn what capabilities this type of deployment gives you and how to configure the deployment.
